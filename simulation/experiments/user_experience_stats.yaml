# This configuration uses duration predictor which predicts based on average duration of previous jobs (including ref. jobs).
# Whenever a job finishes, it is added to the duration index to make the estimates.


# Workers could be either a number or a list that explicitly states a collection of attributes.
# If only a number is given, the workers are initialized with no attributes at the beginning.
# We want all the workers to be 'active'
workers:
  - active: true # one worker dedicated to short jobs only
  - active: true
  - active: true
  - active: true

# Dispatcher component: either a string (fully qualified class name) or a collection with { class, args }
# where class is fully qualified class name and args is list or dict holding constructor arguments.
# The class should implement the `AbstractDispatcher` interface
dispatcher: dispatchers.DurationFilterDispatcher

# Duration predictor: same format as the dispatcher.
# The class should implement the `AbstractDurationPredictor` interface.
